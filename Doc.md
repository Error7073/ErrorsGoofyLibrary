# Error's Goofy Library

Hello fellow skid/scripter. This is an remake of Mob#8610 AEL - ABDExploitingLibrary, I use this mainly for whitelist but I will add more features soon! Thanks if you liked using it.
## Loadstring of EAL
```lua
local Current = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theplantman/ABDExploitLibrary/main/Library%20Versions/V3.lua"))()
```
